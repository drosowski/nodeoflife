nodeoflife
==========
node of life is a simple (rather stupid) implementation of Conway's Game of Life using nodejs, qunit and some other utilities. It was meant to learn a little bit about TDD with JS and the workings of nodejs.

Start it with:
node server.js <port>
Browse to http://localhost:<port>
Click on boxes to activate them and start the game.
